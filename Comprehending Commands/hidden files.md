# Hidden files
The challenge asks to find the flag, hidden as a dot-prepended file in /.

## My solve
**Flag:** ``

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for bash.

```

```

## What I learned
ls doesn't list all the files by default.
Linux has a convention where files that start with a . don't show up by default in ls and in a few other contexts. 
*To view them with ls, you need to invoke ls with the -a flag.*
