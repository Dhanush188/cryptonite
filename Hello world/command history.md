# Command History 
This Challenge asks us to use up and down arrow keys to find the commands used before and grab the flag.  

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QBV70Xo8g-qHPcxU0MuW6UJZSw6.0lNzEzNxwyNwQzNzEzW}'

First we enter the up arrow button. We repeat this until we find the flag which has been injected into the history.
Now we copy and paste the flag.

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{QBV70Xo8g-qHPcxU0MuW6UJZSw6.0lNzEzNxwyNwQzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned how up and down arrow keys can be used to scroll through the saved commands.
